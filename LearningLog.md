One of the big issues I faced in the first practical of programming black was my codes quality. While I was marked highly in my codes functionality I did not realise how bad and important this issue was until recently.

 Very often I would get to a point where I had a peice of code doing what I wanted it to do but when others have had to read and interprit how that code actually works they would get lost. This was no ones fault but my own as much of what I wrote was ***spaghetti code***. I would think about how I could solve the problem at hand not putting enought thought into problems such as.
1. Later development
    * Changing functionality
    * Adding extra functionality
    * Upgrading efficency
    > This would mean even the slightest change of the codes objective would take disproportionatly long with simple tasks becoming neadlessly complex.
1. Working with others
    * Understanding others code
    * Others understanding my code
    * Collaborating efficiently
1. Bug testing
    * Finding Bugs
    * Fixing Bugs without having to entirly re-write
    * Having bugs disguise other bugs
    > This proved the most infuriating of the issues and I belive it is was my weakest link. This proved a meaningful motivator is strengthening my codes quality.
