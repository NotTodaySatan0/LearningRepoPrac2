## *DurHack 2022*
When starting this project I felt lost and it was only after DurHack 2022 that I knew what I wanted to achieve. This is a problem I'm sure many have faced. 

I am breaking this project into parts in attempt to emphasize the importance I believe a hackathon has in gaining the experience of what actual developing environments are like. Having interned at a start up I saw the ordered chaos that actual development can be and being at a hackathon made me feel as if I was starting my own. 

>In my opinion a hackathon should be a mandatory aspect of this project and where better to start then DurHack. 

### <span style="color:Red"> *My Guide to Hackathons (DurHack):*</span>
1. Read Challenges Before Hand

    If you have never been to a hackathon before there is a list of challenges that will be released before every hackathon eg.

1. Build Your Team Beforehand 
    * Saves Time
    * Diversity of skills
    * You will be spending lots of time with these people make sure you work well together.
1. Rely on Sponsor Representatives
    * use Hackathon resources
1. The Demo
    * Best Speaker
    * Why you made the project
    * The value the project adds
1. Compete

    There are many

* Rest before, these are long events don't burnout.
* Go in open minded **your plans will change**.
* Choose a personal objective. 
    
    It's okay if it changes or is dominated by the group objective. I found this something very useful especially when trying to learn something when there are many options.
* Use the Hackathons resources especially lectures.

### Motivation:

All businesses require [communication channels email, text messages, phone calls](https://www.health.org.uk/sites/default/files/Communications-channels.pdf. As annoying as it is to call Amazon and select the 50 different options given to you before you can finally speak to someone, there is a reason businesses do this. It is incredibly efficient. These communications are not specific to customers. Communication within a business are imperative to an efficient work environment. It is important to know how these communications can be done autonomously as it is unavoidable. This was my personal goal for DurHack.

### Background: 

Before starting with 

, and mandatory for every developer to have in their repertoire.

Motivation (10%): Why learn it?
Background (10%): What do you need to know before starting? Include
links to material to catch up. Make it clear who your target audience is
Learning materials (10%): Provide appropriate links to external
resources with commentary
Evaluation (10%):  How useful is the skill, compared with the effort of
learning it? What similar alternatives are there?

# Part 2 
### *Project: ScheduleYouLater*
One of the big issues I faced in the first practical of programming black was my codes quality. While I was marked highly in my codes functionality I did not realize how bad and important this issue was until recently.

 Very often I would get to a point where I had a piece of code doing what I wanted it to do but when others have had to read and interpret how that code actually works they would get lost. Much of what I wrote might be called ***spaghetti code***. I would think about how I could solve the problem at hand not putting enough thought into problems such as.
1. Later development
    * Changing functionality
    * Adding extra functionality
    * Upgrading efficiency
    > This would mean even the slightest change of the codes objective would take disproportionately long with simple tasks becoming needlessly complex.
1. Working with others
    * Understanding others code
    * Others understanding my code
    * Collaborating efficiently
1. Bug testing
    * Finding Bugs
    * Fixing Bugs without having to entirely re-write
    * Having bugs disguise other bugs
    > This proved the most infuriating of the issues and I believe it is was my weakest link. This proved a meaningful motivator is strengthening my codes quality.

## How To Fix the Issue

as much of a cop out answer as it sounds being hard on yourself.

**USE COMMENTS IN YOUR CODE**

If there is a operation which is being used repeatedly throughout the code make a function for it. I have found this helps in 2 ways.
1. Decreases the total lines of code making it quicker to read and understand.
1. Helps identify where issues in the code lie. 

once you have sat with a issue for a while you get a greater insight to it. For others to interact with your code having full understanding of every single line is arduous and wastes time especially in scenarios such as hackathons where time becomes the main factor in what you can achieve. (there isn't a project out of the hackathon that I believe my team would have been unable to complete given infinite time)
